If the program doesn't function and/or spits out runtime errors then make sure you have the newest version of .NET core from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

Instructions for how the standard is used in example.csv and documented fairly thoroughly. Use a command prompt to run the program; once navigating to the folder, the syntax is hapticmaker.exe nameofcsvfile.csv
Alternatively, use the provided batch file and/or edit it with a text editor to point it in the right direction, i.e. changing it from pointing at example.csv to youractualfile.csv

Everything should work fairly smoothly from my tests. The created haptic .json files can be loaded into existing software to be played alongside video or audio files, i.e. https://syncydink.buttplug.world/

See https://buttplug.io/ for more details about connecting devices to take advantage of the vibration.
