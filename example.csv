# Lines starting with a # are ignored by the program. No space prior to the = mark for config, i.e. setCeiling=8 not setCeiling = 8
setCeiling=8
# Globally set Ceiling to adjust values more easily; it lets you use a value of '10' for all spikes if wanted and then do a global adjust without having to do a find-replace.
# Can also do more detailed adjustments but in general, avoid turning vibes all the way off or setting them to max
# default Ceiling is 8
setFloor=2
# Globally set floor for baseline vibes.
# default Floor is 2
# To-Do: Implement baseline patterns instead of just a flat vibe.
setDefStrength=10
# Sets the default spike strength to 10
setDefLength=20
# Sets the default spike length to 20 ds or 2s. Right now spike length is duplicated on each side of the spike, i.e. a 2s ramp up and a 2s ramp down, assuming no other spikes are within the targeted zone
setMinTime=50
# If the total pattern length is less than this (in ds) it will extend it to at least that long
# default Min Time is 50ds or 5s

&&&&TIME START&&&&
# Format is time (in ds or tenths of seconds), optional spike strength (default 10), optional spike length (default 20 ds or 2s). Spaces can be inserted between , or not, stripped out by the program.
# Times do also not need to be sequential, it gets parsed properly by the program regardless.
# ex:
# 192, 7, 17
# At 19.2s, spike at strength 7 for 1.7s
# Separate values with commas. Optional values can be excluded and on need to include extra commas if not required.
# ex:
# 121,5,
# At 12.1s, spike at strength 5 for 2.0s (default)
# ex:
# 2001,,30
# At 200.1s, spike at strength 10 (default) for 3.0s
#
# Delete the timestamps below and just write in your own, then run the application from the command prompt or a batch file.
